PySimpleGUI with MySQL Connector for Office Database

The goal of this is to write a python script and turn it into a standalone program that will take input from the user and save the data into MySQL database. 
Right now, the program can take inputs, save them and view all previous inputs from inside the application. In future updates, the program will be able to print directly onto bank checks and on normal papers as well.
